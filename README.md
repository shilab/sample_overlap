Sample Overlap
==============

overlap.py filters a set of files based on common column names. overlap.py requires at least two files, but will work with more. overlap.py produces new files with the extension ```.out```.

Currently overlap.py only works with tab delimited files.

Usage:
```
overlap.py file1 file2 [file3 ...]
```
